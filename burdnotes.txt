The following migrations will be created for the object models:

rails g migration CreateUsers name:string password_digest:string nausea:integer happiness:integer tickets:integer height:integer --no-test-framework
// add in the boolean value for the user being an admin...or not.

rails g migration CreateAttractions name:string tickets:integer nausea_rating:integer happiness_rating:integer min_height:integer --no-test-framework

rails g migration CreateRides name:string --no-test-framework
// Add the foreign key statements to the tables as shown here:
// https://i.imgur.com/TZbbDay.jpg
// ...because the rides are the "middle-thing" connecting the other two objects just like the "Posts" are in the diagram.


The object models in the seed file appear to have generated properly.  The next step is to create a test script that creates
user, attraction and ride models, then associates them to each other, then also prints out existing model instances & associations.
If this test file can run with no errors, then we know the models are working properly
